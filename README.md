CSC 131 Website. Auto shop that helps admins track progress and logs changes done to vehicles.

A vehicle repair shop needs a platform to manage employee work schedules and customer information along with records of job history and data trends. 
Our website will implement these things in a single platform with customer- and employee-facing pages to streamline the car repair management workflow. 
The website will have a sign up and login feature for customers and mechanics with customers being able to create a profile where they can link vehicles 
into their account and schedule appointments with the vehicle repair shop. Mechanics will be able to post updates to a dashboard for the customers on their 
current jobs where the mechanic was assigned to work on a vehicle for a customer. The job profile will have the vehicle information with the reason it was 
brought in for repair along with having a progress bar that shows the progress of work being done on the job and machanic notes. Admins will be able to use 
information stored in the database to prepare payroll information and review employee performance. Admins will also be in charge of accepting / denying appointment 
requests and assigning mechanice to jobs. Overall this platform aims to streamline the workflow of a vehicle repair shop by effectively managing appointments, 
employee schedules, and customer information. By implementing a user-friendly interface for both customers and employees, the platform ensures smooth interactions
and efficient management.
